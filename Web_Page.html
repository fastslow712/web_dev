        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Long ago Demize tried to seize the triforce. He was imprisoned and his army was scattered. In the effort the humans, Gorons, and Kikwes were almost destroyed. The Gorons and Kikwes became wanderers. What was left of the humans lived in a village on an island in the sky named Skyloft. With the imprisonment of Demise the war ended as his army was scattered as where the Gorons and Kikwes and the humans could not get off Skyloft. Even with the war over, the Gorons and Kikwes still had an occasional scuffle so their peace was not complete. Even so, the semi-peace lasted for hundreds of years.

        <h3>Start of the adventure</h3>
        <p>
            Hundreds of years after the end of the war, the humans, now called the Skyloftens, were still living in peace in Skyloft. Despite the fact that they were living in complete peace, not the semi-peace of the Gorons and Kikwes, they still had a military force even if it was small. The soldiers for this force were trained at the knight academy of Syloft. The students at this academy were divided into two groups, senator and junior. Every year a competition was held. In this competition the junior students competed and the winner moved up to being a senior student. After one of these compositions the headmaster's daughter, Zelda, was pulled down to the surface by a flying black tornado. Then that year's winner, Link, went down to find her.

            <h3>swords</h3>
            <p>
                Over the corse of the adventure links sword changes. The first sword link gets is the practice sword, it is a sword for practice. Next is the skyward sword, it is a sword that when ponted skyward can do a skyward strike. The next is the skyward longsword, it is the skyward sword but magically enhanced. The next sword is the skyward white sword, it is the skyward sword after being enhanced again. The next upgrade of the skyward sword is the master sword, the skyward sword true form. The true master sword is the most powerfull weapon in the game, the true master sword looks more like what most people think of when they think of the master sword. it is the last sword you get.
